                        The "Roadmaps" section is tailored to help Computer Science students navigate the diverse career
                         paths and specializations in the field. This part of the website provides structured guides for
                          popular career tracks such as Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, 
                          and Software Engineering. Each roadmap is broken down into beginner, intermediate, and advanced 
                          stages, highlighting essential skills, tools, and technologies students should master. For example,
                           the Data Science roadmap includes an introduction to statistics, Python programming, and machine 
                           learning models, gradually progressing toward advanced topics like deep learning and big data analytics.
                            With these roadmaps, students can easily identify their interests and work through the steps at their own
                             pace, enabling them to achieve their professional goals effectively.

                        The "College Materials" section is dedicated to supporting students with their academic coursework
                         by providing a vast collection of lecture notes, assignments, slides, past exams, and study guides.
                          This area is categorized by year and subjects, such as programming, algorithms, databases, and operating
                           systems, making it easy for students to find the resources specific to their syllabus. Additionally,
                            the platform supports a peer-to-peer sharing model, where students can upload their own notes and study
                             resources to help others. This department’s primary goal is to create a sense of community and provide
                              students with comprehensive resources to help them succeed in their coursework without having to search
                               across multiple sources.
